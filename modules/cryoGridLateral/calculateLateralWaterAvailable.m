% Function that calculates the real lateral fluxes based on the Darcy
% fluxes and the available water contents of the workers. The idea of the
% fonction is to use the "losing point of view" which considers that
% treating all the losing fluxes (water loss for the worker)  allows to
% treat all the fluxes between workers. Indeed,any gaining flux is a
% loosing flux from the reverse point of view. Therefore only dealing with
% the losing point of view should be enough.
