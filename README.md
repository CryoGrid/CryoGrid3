# CryoGrid3
CryoGrid 3 is a simple land-surface scheme dedicated to modeling of ground temperatures in permafrost environments.
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

The model version of this branch ("xice_mpi_polygon_TC") has been used for the simulations related to the research article "Modelling the degradation of ice-wedges in polygonal tundra under different hydrological conditions" which is intended to be published in the scientific journal "The Cryosphere".

The parameters are set to the default values that were used for the simulations of the research article. Parameters different from the default values can be specified in the main scirpt "CryoGrid3_xice_mpi" (general parameters) and in the function "get_parallel_variables" (tile-specific parameters) which is part of the module "cryoGridLateral".

To start the program, just run the script "CryoGrid3_xice_mpi". The default output directory is "./runs/".
