# CryoGrid3
CryoGrid 3 is a land-surface scheme dedicated to modeling of ground temperatures in permafrost environments. Its excess ice module Xice is capable of simulating ground subsidence and thermokarst lake formation due to melting of excess ground ice. The basic version of CryoGrid 3 and Xice is described in Westermann et al. (2016).

This version (xice_mpi_IS_TC) has been extended to allow simulation of linear infrastructure by defining laterally coupled gravel road embankment tiles. It has been used for a research article in The Cryosphere (TCD 2020, see below).
